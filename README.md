You must click on the bottom buttons to change the colors starting from the top left tile. It'll change the adjacent tiles with the same color, until you fill the board.

Click 'Reset' to restart.

# setup
Install:
* python 2.7
* pygame last version for 2.7
* py2exe (only if making exe)

You can use any notepad to edit the python files (colors.py and engine.py).

For a good debugging experience use Visual Studio with PTVS (Python Tools for VS).

enjoy!
